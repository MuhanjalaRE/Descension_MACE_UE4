# Descension MACE
The purpose is mostly to demonstrate how a hack could be made on any Unreal Engine 4 game in 64-bit fairly easily. There's not much stealth or other methods applied here. It's been sitting unused on my desktop for months so maybe someone can learn something from this.

The game is Midair: Community Edition (Vector Z Studios) (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1231210/Midair_Community_Edition/).

The engine is Unreal Engine 4.23 and the game version is 1.9.1.12285.

## Features
**Visual Aim assist -** Overlay which displays how far you should lead your shots depending on which weapon is equipped.

**ESP and radar -**  Self explanatory.

**OBS Bypass -** Stream and recording proof when using game capture in OBS.

## Status
Currently undetected as there is no Anti-Cheat implemented in the current version of the game. Tested on about a dozen different accounts in pubs, pugs and draft tournaments.

## Credits
**CorrM, dano20zombie, KN4CK3R, tamimego, TheFeckless -** For all the information and tools provided by them for reversing Unreal Engine 4.

**Santeri Soininen/Voidie/Voidspawn -** For his hilariously fragile ego and kneejerk reaction to ban me because of his inability to handle criticism on his subpar art styleðŸ˜‚.

**DarkLord/DL -** For posting the source code of the projectile aim assist which I've added into/used for this hack.
